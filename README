DESCRIPTION
    "pkg" is your tool for creating distributable, modular packages, in a
    variety of programming languages.

    In some languages, there's more than one way to do it (TMTOWTDI!!).
    "pkg" accounts for that as well. You can often choose from a selection
    of packaging styles within a given programming language. You can even
    easily make your own styles.
