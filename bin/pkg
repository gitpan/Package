=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<pkg> is your tool for creating distributable, modular packages, in a variety
of programming languages.

In some languages, there's more than one way to do it (TMTOWTDI!!). C<pkg>
accounts for that as well. You can often choose from a selection of packaging
styles within a given programming language.

=head1 PROJECT GOALS

=over

=item *

Offer a lot of different choices, for popular methods of packaging.

=item *

Provide packaging for languages that don't have their own.

=item *

Keep up with the latest techniques in various languages.

=item *

Be extensible so that people can add their own languages.

=item *

Every package should, at a minimum, offer code, doc, tests and installation
tools.

=item *

Packages should strive to do more things, like build themselves into Debian
packages, RPMs and dmg-s, etc.
